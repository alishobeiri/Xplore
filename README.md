https://devpost.com/software/icaption

Traveling around the world is a fufilling and immersive experience where you're given the opportunity to learn a lot about different cultures. Xplore was built with the goal in mind to provide travelers the ability to connect with other cultures on a greater level. Throughout the process we thought about other use cases for the technology such as helping deaf people. 
Users can just open, the app point the camera and the persons voice translates the sound and feeds back captions.
